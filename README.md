# static-web-page-project
A static webpage created to make a simple desktop webpage using purely HTML and CSS

This project is a mock fan page for the upcoming Final Fantasy 7 remake. I wantee to refresh my HTML and CSS skills and decided on a simple project involving a game that I'm interested in in order to practice.
